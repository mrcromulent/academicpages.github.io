Hi! I am a research student at the Australian National University, working towards a PhD in Astrophysics.

I graduated from the Australian National University (ANU) with a double degree in Science and Mechatronic Engineering (Hons.) in 2019. My current research focuses on modelling the mergers of compact stars in software, in particular looking for crossover with the plasma/fusion energy space.

My research is supervised by [Lilia Ferrario](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/ferrario-l) at the ANU.
