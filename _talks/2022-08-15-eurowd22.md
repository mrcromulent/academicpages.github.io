We present a series of simulations generated with the moving-mesh code AREPO to model the merger of
two White Dwarf (WD) stars. The primary is a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD with a mass of 1.1 M⊙and the
secondary is a helium (He) WD with a mass of 0.35 M⊙. We have found that such a merger resulted in
an edge-lit detonation. Helium burning begins at the base of the primary’s helium layer after a period
of sustained mass deposition while the Carbon detonation occurs 0.2-0.3 seconds later below the helium
detonation layer. The variable composition WD structure was produced using the White Dwarf Evolution
Code (WDEC), which generates 1D structures from a set of inputs that includes total mass and effective
temperature. This represents an improvement on various prior works which are limited to isothermal,
constant composition structures. The time evolution of the merger and associated nuclear reactions are
computed by AREPO, which has the ability to evaluate the equations of Ideal MHD using a Finite Volume
Method (FVM) on a large, unstructured grid.
