We attempt to use simulation codes from the world of plasma fusion (FINESSE and PHOENIX) to investigate localised thermonuclear runaway on compact stars. 

Hameury and Lasota (1985) previously investigated the possibility of localised accretion at the polar caps of magnetized white dwarfs and arrived at a semi-analytical model which explained some observations. However, an analysis of instabilities was absent from their investigation. 

We attempt to use fusion plasma codes to investigate the influence of these instabilities.
